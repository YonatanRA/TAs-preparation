    "In this challenge you will mine SwitchUp's site (a bootcamp review platform) to retrieve information on the most highly ranked bootcamps. There are five different divisions of bootcamps, each with their own ranking. These are: 'Best Coding Bootcamps', 'Best Online Bootcamps', 'Best Data Science Bootcamps', 'Best Web Design Bootcamps', and 'Best Cyber Security Bootcamps'.  \n",

    "Your task is to scrape information for the top 20 bootcamps on a ranking list. This information should include:  ranking, rating (out of 5), number of reviews, cost (of 4 dollar signs), and the short summary provided by SwitchUp. It is not necessary to include other information.\n",
