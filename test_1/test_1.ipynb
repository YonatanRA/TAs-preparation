    "One of the core tasks fo any Data Analytics project is Data Mining. One of the useful tools that we teach at Ironhack is Web Scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part you can find 3 different tasks, which will evaluate your skills in CSS3 selectors and regular expressions knowledge, which are essential to data extraction processes. We believe that even if you do not have previous knowledge of CSS, HTML and REGEX, you should be able to complete this task in less than a hour. There are many tutorials and informations on how to use CSS3 selectors and regular expressions to extract data. Do not be afraid to google it! This task is also a evaluation of your learning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal questions already have some examples and can be solved only by filling the CSS3 selectors or the regular expressions in the given space. You can check if you have the correct results by running the pre-made script after it. However, if you feel comfortable, you can use another python package and rewrite the script in a similar way to extract the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the extra challenges, you'll need to construct the scripts from scratch."
